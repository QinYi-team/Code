% Calculates the kurtosis K of the complete quinte wavelet packet transform
% w of signal x, 计算五层小波包分解的峭度
% up to nlevel, using the lowpass and highpass filters h and g,
% respectively. 直到最后一层，分别用低通与高通滤波器
% The WP coefficients are sorted according to the frequency
% decomposition.小波包系数根据频率分解分类
% This version handles both real and analytical filters, but does not yiels WP coefficients
% suitable for signal synthesis.这个角本处理实信号与解析信号滤波，但不适用于合成信号的小波包系数
